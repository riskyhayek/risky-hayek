# Risky Hayek dot COM 🌶️

Risky Hayek is here, and has it's own website!

## How to run

In local, it is a simple streamlit app. So just run:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The only environment variable you need to set is `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY`, look for it at 1Password.


## How to deploy
